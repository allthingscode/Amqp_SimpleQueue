= PHP AMQP Simple Queue (amqplib wrapper) =


- Purpose -
Provide a simple PHP library for interacting with a AMQP queue.

The library contains only the essential methods needed to enqueue, retrieve a message, and dequeue.

This library requires the php-amqplib libary in order to work.  This is just a simplified abstraction layer for working with a simple queue.


- Install -
All of the files are meant to live in a directory call "Amqp".
Create this directory somewhere in the php include path, and then add all the files.



- Dependancies -
php-amqplib (search github)
